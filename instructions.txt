I want to make a script that scrapes tweets. I need to hit:

https://api.socialdata.tools/twitter/user/<username>

To get the ID

And then

https://api.socialdata.tools/twitter/user/<userId>/tweets-and-replies[?cursor=<cursor>]

To get the tweets (see example.json).

It looks like it loads about 43 (might depend on the data in the tweets), as well as a 'cursor'

You should write a function to fetch `count` tweets, which will call the fetch endpoint until >= the requested number of tweets are retrieved (or no more are available).

fetchTweets(username, count=50): Tweet[]

You should also write a main script that runs from the command line and takes in user input (`<username> <count>`, with count being optional) and invokes the function and saves the results as JSON (`<username>-<date>.json`). It should also save the results as markdown, in the following format:

<username> - <date>
<tweet_text>

Include quoted tweets at the end of the tweet text, with full detail, each line prepended with >

Use axios and dotenv-safe to load SOCIAL_DATA_API_KEY into env
